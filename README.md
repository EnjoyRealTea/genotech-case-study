**DNA Sequence Analyser  - A Case Study focussing on string manipulation**

Task: To develop a DNA sequence analyser. Using advanced string functions, the program should identify specific patterns, match them to known genetic markers, and even predict possible traits based on these sequences.

The concepts consolidated by this case study:
- String Manipulation
- Predicting Traits
- Formatting & Standardisation

Once the user has inputted the desired text into the document, the following features will be offered to the user:
- Allow the program to be capable of reading long DNA sequences, which are essentially strings of nucleotides represented by the letters A, T, C and G.
- Identify specific patterns, match them to known genetic markers, and predict possible traits based on these sequences.
- Additionally, the program should offer functionalities like converting the entire sequence to uppercase for uniformity, replacing specific nucleotide patterns, and splitting sequences based on certain markers.
